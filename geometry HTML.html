            <h2>What is Geometry?</h2>
            <p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the sizes, shapes, positions, angles, and dimensions of things. It involves understanding and solving problems related to the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, and solids.</p>

            <h2>Basic Geometric Shapes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Circle: A round shape with all points at the boundary having the same distance from the center.</li>
                <li>Square: A quadrilateral with all four sides of equal length and all angles at 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>Triangle: A polygon with three edges and three vertices.</li>
                <li>Rectangle: A quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and all angles at 90 degrees.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Point: An exact location in space with no dimensions.</li>
                <li>Line: A straight one-dimensional figure having no thickness and extending infinitely in both directions.</li>
                <li>Angle: Formed by two rays (or lines) that share a common endpoint (or vertex).</li>
                <li>Plane: A flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Geometry</h2>
            <p>Geometry is used in various fields such as art, architecture, engineering, robotics, astronomy, and many more. It helps in understanding spatial relationships and properties of physical spaces.</p>
